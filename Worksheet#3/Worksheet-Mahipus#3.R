#Based on the above vector LETTERS:
# a. You need to produce a vector that contains the first 11 letters.
LETTERS[1:11]
#b. Produce a vector that contains the odd numbered letters.

#c. Produce a vector that contains the vowels
#Based on the above vector letters:

#Based on the above vector letters:
#d. Produce a vector that contains the last 5 lowercase letters.
letters[21:26]
#e. Produce a vector that contains letters between 15 to 24 letters in lowercase.

#2a. What is the R code and its result for creating a character vector for the city/town of
#Tuguegarao City, Manila, Iloilo City, Tacloban, Samal Island, and Davao City? Name the
#object as city. The names should follow the same order as in the instruction.

#b. The average temperatures in Celcius are 42, 39, 34, 34, 30, and 27 degrees.
