# Worksheet 2

1.Create a vector using : operator 


a.Sequence from -5 to 5. Write the R code and its output. Describe its output.

```{}
seq(-5:5)
```
b.x <- 1:7. What will be the value of x?
Rcode:
```{}
x <- 1:7
```
2.Create a vector using seq() function
a. seq(1, 3, by=0.2) # specify step size
Write the R code and its output. Describe the output.
      Rcode:
```{}
seq(1,3,by= 0.2)
```
3.A factory has a census of its workers. There are 50 workers in total. The following list shows their ages: 34, 28, 22, 36, 27, 18, 52, 39, 42, 29, 35, 31, 27, 22, 37, 34, 19, 20, 57, 49, 50, 37, 46, 25, 17, 37, 43, 53, 41, 51, 35,
24,33, 41, 53, 40, 18, 44, 38, 41, 48, 27, 39, 19, 30, 61, 54, 58, 26,
18.

a.Access 3rd element, what is the value?
```{}
Workers[3]
```
b.Access 2nd and 4th element, what are the values?
```{}
Workers[2]
Workers[4]
```
c.Access all but the 1st element is not included. Write the R code and its output.
```{}
Workers[2:49]
```
4.Create a vector x <- c("first"=3, "second"=0, "third"=9). Then named the vector, names(x).
a.Print the results. Then access x[c("first", "third")]. Describe the output.
```{}
x <- c("first"=3, "second"=0, "third"=9)
```
b.Write the code and its output.
```{}
names(x)
```
5.	Create a sequence x from -3:2.
a.Modify 2nd element and change it to 0;x[2] <- 0 x
Describe the output.
```{}
x <- -3:2
x[2] <- 0
x
```
b.Write the code and its output.
```{}
x <- -3:2
x[2] <- 0
x
[1] -3  0 -1  0  1  2
```

6.The following data shows the diesel fuel purchased by Mr. Cruz.

Month	Jan	Feb	March	Apr	May	June
Price per liter (PhP)	52.50	57.25	60.00	65.00	74.25	54.00
Purchase–quantity(Liters)	25	30	40	50	10	45

a.Create a data frame for month, price per liter (php) and purchase-quantity (liter).Write the codes.
```{}
Month <- c("Jan", "Feb", "March", "Apr", "May", "June")
Price_per_liter_php <- c(52.50, 57.25, 60.00, 65.00, 74.25, 54.00)
Purchase_quantity_liter <- c(25, 30, 40, 50, 10, 45)  

data_frame <- data.frame(Month, Price_per_liter_php, Purchase_quantity_liter )
data_frame

```
b.What is the average fuel expenditure of Mr. Cruz from Jan to June? Note: Use
weighted.mean(liter, purchase)
```{}
weighted.mean(Price_per_liter_php, Purchase_quantity_liter)
```
7.R has actually lots of built-in datasets. For example, the rivers data “gives the lengths
(in miles) of 141 “major” rivers in North America, as compiled by the US Geological Survey”.

a.Type “rivers” in your R console. Create a vector data with 7elements, containing the number of elements (length) in rivers, their sum (sum), mean (mean), median (median), variance (var) standard deviation (sd), minimum (min) and maximum (max).
data <- c(length(rivers), sum(rivers), mean(rivers), median(rivers), var(rivers), sd(rivers), min(rivers), max(rivers))
```{}
data <- c(length(rivers), sum(rivers), mean(rivers), median(rivers), var(rivers),
          sd(rivers), min(rivers), max(rivers))
data
```
b.What are the results?
```{}
[1]    141.0000  83357.0000    591.1844    425.0000 243908.4086    493.8708
[7]    135.0000   3710.0000
```
c.Write the code and its outputs.
```{}
data <- c(length(rivers), sum(rivers), mean(rivers), median(rivers), var(rivers),
          sd(rivers), min(rivers), max(rivers))
data

[1]    141.0000  83357.0000    591.1844    425.0000 243908.4086    493.8708
